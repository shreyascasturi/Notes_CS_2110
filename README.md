# Notes_CS_2110
After taking CS 2110 (and "passing" it), I became increasingly fixated
on proving that I knew the material, even when I clearly didn't know the material.

This matter became one of utmost importance given my future studies would no doubt use 2110 concepts -- if I didn't know these 
concepts like the back of my hand (I never did remember what the back of my hand looked like), then I would surely,
as the inductive proofs would show, fail not just in a singular case but in all cases.

Because I have some -- admittedly limited -- skill in TeX, I decided to use TeX to format my chapters. In following FOSS
principles, I have decided to make these notes free-to-use and edit, in order to at least try to open-source parts of the GT CS 
curriculum wherever I could.

The problem right now will be trying to be comprehensive but still concise -- currently I'm writing from behind -- 
as of Fall 2019, the 2110 lectures are already near Lecture 11, whereas I'm currently stuck on Lecture 3. Because of the
fast pace of the material, this means I have to double-time my efforts to first get to where the lectures are, and
then get past them. This means weekends are the only way to keep pace, but writing in TeX, as many of you will no doubt find out,
is beyond torturous and difficult.

Anyways, feel free to check out the material. There's one curse word in Chapter 1, which'll be fixed out as soon as I know
how to use TikZ.

Best,
S.C.
